Live Canada and US COVID19 Dashboard

Please check the website : https://corona-ca.herokuapp.com/

This website is an interactive dashboard to report and monitor Coronavirus COVID-19 cases in Canada.

This dashboard is updated several times a day. All the data in this dashboard is gathered from Canada provincial websites.

This dashboard is built using Dash interactive Python framework. It automatically scrapes the Canada COVID-19 websites using Python and updates the metrics.

This dashboard is well-suited for laptop and desktop views and not currently perfectly designed for mobile phones.

All the maps and charts in this dashboard are interactive and you can hover over and zoom in and zoom out to different provinces and regions.
